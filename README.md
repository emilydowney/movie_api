# Movie API
A movie REST API built from scratch utilizing pieces of the MERN stack. The API is accessible through common HTTP methods such as GET and POST. Authetication via user login is required to access certain information. Data is retrieved from a database, where it is stored in a non-relational manner. This API will act as the server-side component to a full web application. 
## Features
* Allows users to register, edit their own profile, and add/remove favorite movies.
* Users can browse movies based on titles, genres, and directors.
* Searchs will return movies accompanied by a poster, short bio, director information, etc.
* Existing users can deregister from the app.
